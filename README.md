## Features
 * Launch the js scripts.
 * Edit the Host.
 * Edit the Port.
 * Edit the Username.

##Important
Its just a launcher without scripts it won't do anything.
You have a lot of scripts made by people who are very good at it.

It may not work with all scripts. Because to display the host, port and username it will look for the dedicated code in the selected file. In fact, the connection code must be in the main file.
